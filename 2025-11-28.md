# back on dex

Honestly, I can't believe I am back on samsung DeX. But I found a method that works really well -- I learned more about my lapdock, which still isn't perfect by any means. But the main thing is using an external mouse. Using the laptdock as mainly a monitor and nothing else has been helpful. Of course, it has the added benefit of being battery powered, and it does have a keyboard/trackpad for when I need it. But just about any keyboard and mouse are better than the integrated ones.

I have also been working on my wifes project for christmas. The coin pusher has come along and its just about done. I needed to add some plexi glass sides and that is now attached, just letting it set up now.

Lets see, has there been anything else new? Ah yes:

Phones suck right now.

I was considering an upgrade for black friday. My samsung galaxy s23 FE is really starting to show its age -- particularly in the storage department. But I couldn't find any deals that were actually compelling by any means. I am not sure what might come next, but I think I will wait for the next big device to come out -- probably the galaxy s26 ultra? Not 100% yet.

Anyways, thats enough shouting into the void for today.
