## No *REAL* update, except the *REALEST* one

So, this past week I have shifted focus onto actually creating. I have a few new additions to all of my repositories. A new 3d design, and in fact the most complex design I have ever done, a CDL framework and a crappy benchmarking app. I have enjoyed doing these things, but I feel unproductive to some degree with so few committs. I haven't come up with a better way of doing this dev blog as I don't want this readme to get so long it becomes impractical. But I am indeed proud of the amount of work I did this week.

I did all this all while the new old school runescape skill came out! That, for me, is an impressive feat! I have been enjoying sailing, but I am currently back to training agility, if that matters to you at all.

I have a new mouse coming, if that matters.

Nothing else to report. Just excited about the variety and veracity of the work I've done this week. Still need to think about what I will do about the devblog. Will try not updating every day again. Next week.

Till next time

## Last DevBlog for a little while?

I enjoy this DevBlog. But I was doing some thinking, maybe I don't need to do it every day, it can be more a weekly update thing and I just have it updated for that week. I could even make a new file for each week? I am unsure as of right now. The goal for now is to just try and decide how I want to do this moving forward. I will probably next update this specific repo in a weeks time with what I've decided along with my updates to shout into the void. But I am also unacertain. If I come up with an idea of how I want to do it going forward that still allows for more posts, I will make an update sooner than a week. But as I have been thinking about it, I would like the DevBlog to be a *DEV* Blog and less of just a blog. I think the DevBlog should be more about what I have been working on, and less just ramblings into the void.

The idea is that each week I go over what I've done from all my different tech passions -- from CDL frameworks, to 3d designs, programming (on the rare occasion) to hardware changes I've made in my setup. I also like the idea of a blog though -- as I don't have any real important tech updates to make sure everyone (which is literally nobody) to concern themselves with. So a little blog allows me to just talk about my nerdy tech stuff I enjoy. So I am not sure what the plan is going forward just yet, but instead of constantly throwing out 3 sentence ramblings each day, I would like to have something a little more... directed? Poignant? I am not sure. I write this update as it is the start of me figuring it out.

## Driver Updates/Conevex Fillet Gauge

I updated my MX Linux drivers in prep for my Intel Arc B580. It will be arriving on the 19th making designing and printing projects massively better. After slicing an model, I like to look at it to see what might need changing, but it always chugs on my integrated graphics. After a lot of discussion with my coworkers, I stuck with my original idea of the B580 because of the linux driver support and price point for being new. My coworkers suggested the GTX 1080 -- which is still, to this day, a beautiful card. But I wanted something new, and future proof for what I do, especially on linux. Which meant the B580 was probably the best choice. Getting it at $250 USD, in white (matches my build,) on sale with a bundled gift (which I already gave away) with RGB -- IN STOCK? I couldn't say no.

Now I just have to wait for it to arrive and I can install it after doing all the prep work of updating the drivers and everything and I *should* be able to just plug it in and be off to the races. Designing and printing should be a BREEZE with this thing.

I also added a new design to my portfolio -- a convex fillet gauge. I printed a concave fillet gauge I really like, but there are often times where I am looking to design something to fit into something else that already exists (like an altoids tin or something) and I needed a gauge that would tell me what I need the curve to be to fit inside of that, so I designed a fillet gauge to estimate that better, taking design ideas from my existing favorite gauge. This will allow me to design more efficiently and accurately!

If you're interested, check out my 3d designs repo.

Okay, enough shouting into the void today.

## Community Chess Challenge/fest

Today was the community chess challenge that I hosted at our local museum. It went well! I love chess, especially bullet chess. But it does mean that my tech stuff took a back seat. I am enjoying reclaiming the engineering part of my tech identity, even if I am not *always* doing it. Which reminds me, I am so excited for this arc b580 to come because its going to upgrade my 3d development *so* much.

As train of thought, while at the community chess challenge, we played bullet over the board. I had so much fun. Didn't lose a single game of speed chess and drew a the only long game I played. Of course, I was putting it on, so I didn't play as many games, but I did stil play some and it was just a good reminder that I am always playing against people my level online, which means tougher and tougher competition as I get better and better.

Anyways, enough rambling, just wanted to make sure I got in here and said something.

Goodbye to the void!

## BUSY!

I have been so incredibly busy lately, and mostly given up on being 100% mobile. I have instead focused my energy on something more tangible and practical in 3d design and printing. I definitly have been so busy at work that I haven't even had time to come here and update this transition, but hey, I'm here when I can screaming into the void. I also am not sure how long I plan on letting this dev blog to go on -- I might just do a single update and delete everything else at some point? But that defeats the purpose -- for me its to look back at what I was thinking about while I was working on things. Regardless, Ive made an update and there is now a repository for my 3d designs all linked. I don't exactly feel like adding them to more known repositories -- mainly because it creates more of a hassle than just sharing a link, especially when my github serves as my more complete identity.

Work has been so incredibly busy that I haven't had much time to do anything on here. I have done 2 designs since I got so incredibly busy. And I did finally cave and buy an intel arc b580 for design reasons mainly -- also slicers get pretty slow on preview with so many more polygons added after the actual slicing is done.

Any time I do a 3d design, though, I will add it to the readme in the 3d design repo. So, go check it out, theres already quite a few that I have been willing to share in there.

## Mobile day

Right now I am writing this on the mobile website with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Not on Samsung DeX like I would think I normally would. I enjoy samsung DeX but I seem to get more utility out of my computational world by having more of an ecosystem rather than a single device.

This is more a test of this keyboard because I haven't used this keyboard in quite a while. At any rate, I enjoy this so I can do chess puzzles on mobile with my mouse, have my main PC up, and have my other laptop working movies and videos on the side.

As a result of this test, this keyboard is okay, but I think I definitely want a better on ue to the locations this one folds into.

*edit 1:* I have changed keyboards and have another one on the way. The keyboard I was using earlier today had a massive problem. It was a folding keyboard whose fold was right where I hit the space bar and it really got annoying fast. So I have a loaner one right now and have a better keyboard on the way.

I also have a charging station on the way to charge my various peripherals and devices. From battery packs to headphones to keyboard, mouse, maybe even my watch and my mobile. I also decided I actually do enjoy using both portrait as well as landscape modes and so am printing a phone stand that will allow my mobile to charge in portrait mode while on its stand.

I write very stream of consciousness here and I know that, but its fun. I am just typing into the void anyways, so I don't see any problems as of yet.

## Physical Tech projects and Samsung DeX

I have gone and done it -- used github inappropriately again. I made a repo for mor physical projects that includes Samsung DeX or 3d printing projects. I have already uploaded one project -- specifically my daily driving of Samsung DeX. It is enjoyable that I get to use my most personal computer (my "phone") as my main PC other than complete workhorse type stuff. Ever since the advent of the app "Slice Beam" which is a mobile 3d slicer, I don't particularly need a desktop. Its still enjoyable to have one, sure but not as easy as this. I uploaded an image of my DeX setup, but I've already got a 3d printing project to show, I just need to document it.

## Need Instructive Losses

I have been thinking about my chess data CDL framework (found here: https://github.com/BoyoLabs/CDL-Frameworks/blob/main/ChessData.cdl.md ) and I have realized that in bullet, there aren't very many instructive losses -- or rather that there is plenty to learn from analyzing your wins because theres still so much that you did wrong in bullet, but losses are just immediate punishments of those problems. You learn less because its the same problems as in wins, but with literally less data. That doesn't make them unimportant for a CDL framework however. As those datapoints will be useful for the LLM to notice how quickly they get punished. My focus for that CDL is to try to incorperate more losses. Not because there is more data (in fact theres less) but because I want to teach the LLM that these losses can be quickly punished. I need to find some good ones though to add so it can really tell whats going on.

I have gone on to update my GitHub significantly. I am consolidating my CDL frameoworks into one repo with what they do as an explanation. This way, I can consolidate my repos into their goals and the projects will be individuals within there rather than having an individual repo per project. I am doing this because I plan on using my GitHub as, effectively, my lab. Or rather, the documentation for my lab. There will be a repo for 3d design/printing as well as hardware and mobile projects. But I will create those as I move forward. *update: I have them consolidated into CDL frameworks, DevBlog and WebApps as my main repos. If I choose to delve into something like pythong again, I will, but have no intentions at this time. The 3d design/printing one will come when I decide to publish my first item*

I have been thinking about what other CDL frameworks I would want to make, and for right now, I think I am actually pretty okay just working on my chessData one. I don't want to jump from idea to idea too quickly.

## dev blog idea / catching up to now

Lately, I have been incredibly busy. Studying chess and working with our chickens, yard work and house work. Living in the country is a ton of work. However, I have had some time to test out both Lexl (an LLM enhancement tool, found here: https://github.com/BoyoLabs/Lexl ) as well as my first pet project in the foray into meta programming with prompt and context engineering in the form of what I like to call Contextual Data Logic (CDE) frameworks -- chessData (found here: 
https://github.com/BoyoLabs/CDL-Frameworks/blob/main/ChessData.cdl.md )

I have completely given up on the IDE for CDE, promptForge. Its a neat idea, but really, CDE is just a modified markdown language and other IDEs far better work just fine. My goal isn't to build an IDE after all.

However, I have been working on a tool that gets AI to generate the CDE code! It isn't perfect, and it's not supposed to be. It only generates a starting point so I (or the user) doesn't need to make everything themselves. I still need to add the data set (if one is required) and I can always add specific functions and conditionals.

I am particularly interested in this method of programming because I went to school for philosophy and have a love for formal logic on top of other educational background (AI prompt engineering cert from vanderbilt, and IT Support Professional Certificate from google) and my professional background (teaching computer science k-12 and now working an internal IT role for a company.) I have always had an interest in programming -- particularly web development with an emphasis on javascript and later taught python as the preferred educational language. It seems this meta-programming with CDL has sort of merged all my skills together. This is why I think I enjoy it so much.

So, without much further catching up, why am I making a dev blog? Well, I want to! Do I really need a further reason? However, if you must know, I really enjoy being involved. And I am not always working directly on my projects. This is a good way for me to blow off steam and not be working on my projects while remaining involved. I wont promise how often I will post a dev blog, but as my work continues -- some of it in the background with no commits -- I can remind myself of what I have been doing and remind myself that I am making progress, even if it doesn't look like it.

On a final note for todays entry, I am considering uploading all of my tech projects here. By this, I mean that even 3d print projects may find their way here. I would like to use github as a sort of social media for my tech world and work. I have never actually gone through with that sort of thing on here before. So, it might be fun, who knows.

Okay, anyways, thats enough shouting into the void for one session.

distro: MX Linux

Okay bye.
