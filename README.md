# 🛠️ The LabLog: The Engineer's Applied Systems Blog

This repository serves as **The Engineer's Logbook** for all projects under the **Boyo Labs** umbrella.

The name "LabLog" is a mashup of **"Lab"** (where experiments and engineering happen) and **"Blog"** (where observations and personal reflections are shared). Here, engineering rigor meets country living narrative.

I apply a systematic approach to everything:

* **Technical Systems:** 3D Design (CAD), Fabrication (3D Printing), Software Development, and IT Infrastructure.
* **Physical Systems:** Homestead optimization, resource management, and resilience engineering for the land.
* **Cognitive Systems:** Strategic planning, process analysis, and philosophical insights from the day-to-day.

Expect entries that detail the *design rationale* of a new part, the *performance metrics* of the chicken operation, frustration logs, and highlights of our family's systemic approach to life.
