# Finding a Groove Again

Recently, I have been doing a lot of work with php and backend stuff. That stuff is fun and interesting, but in all honesty, I have always had the most fun with developing something more on the front end. This doesn't mean I will never code in php again, it simply means my focus is on html/css/js rather than adding some backend stuff. It seems today in the modern coding/programming landscape, there is always a workaround for what I am trying to do. I found this out with experimenting with pubnub making a chatroom.

I have had fun setting up my server, and I will continue to work on it, but I have always been, first and foremost when it comes to tech, a developer. I want to get back to that being my focus. With this said, I have also preferred supposed "static" pages/apps because of the hassle setting up a server can be. That doesn't mean I wont do it or anything, but its just not my jam. If I can do a workaround, I absolutely will.

With this being said, I have also learned how outdated php really is since I last dove heavily into development. So with that, its almost like its already unnecessary.

I have developed 3 apps *today.* All experimental, and one thats definitely far from being finished. It is coming along though! It is perhaps my most exciting app since critterlog for me -- a web based 3d slicer for 3d printing. I have even set up github pages for the main-dev repo so that my SPA's are accessible instantly.

In a way, I am treating github as my development server. That is the easiest implementation for my apps.

Okay, thats enough shouting into the void. I had a good time.
