## Server Creation

I am indeed working on putting together a server. I never thought I would actually do this, but here I am. I thought about just hosting, but I really am not a fan because of the limited storage space and the pricing. Instead, I have a little optiplex and I'll be using a ddns. It'll just be a little apache server running on mx linux and I'll host web apps that I either make or find some cool open source ones. I already intend on using this for emulatorJS and tinyfilemanager. I also will be making a landing page for which to access all of the different web apps that I will be implementing.

The reason I am not going with proxmox is because I just don't want to -- its overcomplicating setup for using one thing, the web server. I also am doing a ddns over a static IP because I don't need to spend extra money to have one bestowed upon me. Plus, with a ddns I sort of get a sub domain name too as a result which is quite cool, and its free! Can't complain there!

Anyways, All I've gotten done today is simply building the physical server itself. As an old optiplex it sort of needed an overhaul and I gave it one for sure.

Excited to see what the future holds for this project!
