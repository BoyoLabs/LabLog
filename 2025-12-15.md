# Taking Some Time

Lately, I have been hard at work getting this server running effectively. In particular, dealing with some DNS issues on both client and server side. I got them fixed. Great.

I also got the communal christmas present as done as it needs to be. Also great.

But I am tired currently. So I will be taking a bit of a break. I have some hardware changes coming to the server, and at the moment, I don't have any clear ideas of apps to make or anything like that and I don't feel the need to force myself into making something crazy. I made an app that guesses what a thing is with a picture on a 15MB AI model. Its pretty basic, but it works. I think its a seratonin grab and thus, not very good. With this in mind, my break is going to be based on just maybe adding some games to the server via emulatorJS and waiting for the hardware to arrive.

But for now, I am really just going to take a brief break.

Maybe some 3d models, not sure. But don't be surprised if theres radio silence for a week or so.

Thanks for hearing me the void.

Bye.
